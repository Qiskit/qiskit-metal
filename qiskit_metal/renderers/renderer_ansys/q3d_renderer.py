        Initiate rendering of components in design contained in selection, assuming they're valid.
        Components are rendered before the chips they reside on, and subtraction of negative shapes
        is performed at the very end.

        Chip_subtract_dict consists of component names (keys) and a set of all elements within each component that
        will eventually be subtracted from the ground plane. Add objects that are perfect conductors and/or have
        meshing to self.assign_perfE and self.assign_mesh, respectively; both are initialized as empty lists. Note
        that these objects are "refreshed" each time render_design is called (as opposed to in the init function)
        to clear QAnsysRenderer of any leftover items from the last call to render_design.

        Among the components selected for export, there may or may not be unused (unconnected) pins.

        specify exactly which pins should be open rather than shorted during the simulation. Both the
        component and pin name must be specified because the latter could be shared by multiple
        components. All pins in this list are rendered with an additional endcap in the form of a
        rectangular cutout, to be subtracted from its respective plane.
