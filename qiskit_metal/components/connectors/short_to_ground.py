    Inherits `QComponent` class


    Options:
        * width: the width of the 'cpw' terminating to ground (this is merely for the purpose of
          generating a value to pass to the pin)
        * pos_x/_y: the x/y position of the ground termination.
        * rotation: the direction of the termination. 0 degrees is +x, following a
          counter-clockwise rotation (eg. 90 is +y)
        * chip: the chip the pin should be on.
        * layer: layer the pin is on. Does not have any practical impact to the short.

    Values (unless noted) are strings with units included, (e.g., '30um')
