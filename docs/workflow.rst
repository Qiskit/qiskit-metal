Qiskit Metal Workflow
*********************

Qiskit Metal enables chip prototyping in a matter of minutes. You can start from a convenient Python Jupyter notebook or take advantage of the user-friendly graphical user interface (GUI). Simply choose from a library of predefined quantum components, such as transmon qubits and coplanar resonators, and customize their parameters in real-time to fit your needs. Use the built-in algorithms to automatically connect components. Easily implement new experimental components using Python templates and examples.

Designing quantum devices is the bedrock of the quantum ecosystem, but it is a difficult, multi-step process that connects traditionally disparate worlds.  Metal is automating and streamlining this process.
